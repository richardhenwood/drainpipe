This is the README for 'Neuralyte Tracker'

-- Overview -- 

Neuralyte Tracker is a tracker. The rendering engine is provided by IBXM.
Grizzly and Jersey are employed to provide a RESTful interface. The interface
is written in HTML/JS. Net.sf.json provides json utility functions.

Given the interface is written in HTML/JS, and rendered in a web browser, you
may wish to redirect the audio output at the internet. This operating mode is
referred to as 'cloud utility' mode. 

Cloud utility mode does not require any modification to staring Neuralyte
Tacker - to enable cloud utility mode you fiddle with pulseaudio and do the
network streaming at that level. If you see mention of pulseaudio, parec,
oggenc it is talking about cloud utility mode and can be ignored for a basic
operating mode.

Basic operating mode is when you are running Neuralyte Tracker on a machine
that has audio out and is within ear-shot.


-- Getting started --

To get working, you should install linux, cd into this directory, and then:
  mvn assembly:assembly

then
  ./run_neuralyte_tracker.sh

then point your browser at (for basic operating mode):
  http://localhost:8888/drainpipe
